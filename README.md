this is how to install this react project which i made with my friends at unifor in 2021, its stilla work in progress and you amy run into depreciated depencys, but heres the general formula

**front**
opent erminal
press cd front
do npm i
do npm start

**back**
open terminal
type cd back
type npm i
type nodemon src/server.js
if that doesnt work try npm i express nodemon

**additional information**
the front is supposed to run a tport 8000 whilist the back is made to run at port 5000, taht cannot be cahnged as it would make the project not work
